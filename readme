A note on usage of the program compiled (.exe):
	to use this program in it's exe compiled state; you must use the command prompt in windows 
	when you download the .zip file and extract it; take note of the location of the folder as we need this directory path. 
	change to that directory (for more information see the brief tutorial on traversing the command prompt file directory)
	copy the excel sheet into that directory for ease of use. 
	run the following line once you are in the file directory. 
	signGenerator.exe "name of excel file.xlsx" 
	PRO TIP: You can use the tab key to "auto complete" a file name or directory name
	press enter. the screen should do nothing for a brief moment; then if you look in the directory; there will be another directory inside called wordFiles
	wordfiles is where we have the newly generated word documents

A note on potential bugs and solutions to them:
	if you have the excel sheet open: you will not be able to use this application as windows locks down the xlsx file when in use. 
	if you have one of the word documents open and you try to rerun the script; the script will crash as windows locks down word files. 

command prompt quick reference guide:
	all commands must be finished by pressing enter. 
	get current directory:
	cd
	go back a directory
	cd ../
	go forward a directory
	cd ChildDirectoryName
	
	Helpful hints:
		You can use tab to auto complete.
		you can copy the directory you need to get to from by typing in cd, copying the full path, going to the command prompt 
			and right clicking (ensuring there's a space between cd and the path)

A guide on compiling the application for future generations:
	Ensure you have openpyxl, python-docx, and pyinstaller installed. if pyinstaller doesn't outright work with the command; you may have to ensure it's in the path. 
	python-docx, openpyxl, and pyinstaller can all be installed via pip. 
	if you run into pip errors; take a breath. read up on the instructions patiently, update how they tell you to update and keep trying: you got this, I believe in you. 
	ensure there's an empty directory called wordFiles in your folder when you compile it as this is where it's located.
	if you're having trouble finding where you compiled this; it'll be in a directory named dist
